The files contain: 
1) Abundance table and genomic content network for Stool sample of HMP (HMP_Stool.mat): Table of abundance at stain level of 553 stool samples from the HMP (http://www.hmpdacc.org/ ).
2) Matlab scripts (script_FR_GCN_randomization.m & script_FR_otu_randomization): The matlab code imports the abundance table and genomic content network, calculates the functional redundancy for the real abundance and genomic content network and also for the randomized counterpart, and then plot the figures.
4) Matlab script (Genomo_evolution_model.m) of a genome evolution model. In this script, we use the Nestedness Temperature Calculator to quantify and visualize the nested structure of genomic content network, which is based on the BINMATNESS algorithm (https://bimat.github.io/alg/nestedness.html).
3) Matlab functions used by the scripts.

Running the tutorial:
1) Download all the files in this repository to a local directory.
2) Run the Matlab file. Running times for both of the scripts are less than 1 min. 
(The code was written on MATLAB R2016b)

Output:
1) Matlab figure showing normalized functional redundancy of real abundance and genomic content network compared with that for randomized genomic content network (left) and for randomized abundance table (right).
2) Mann-Whitney U test p values and adjusted q values (Benjamini-Hochberg).
